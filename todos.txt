General
=======


Docker Setup
============
    * Use node user instead of root (RB)
    * reduce node packages to a minimum (in package.json) (RB)
    * use specific process for startup instead of npm start (RB)
    * check that the WATCHPACK_POLLING=true workaround for Windows in package.json works for Mac as well (CSC)

Database
========


Backend
=======
    * error handling: always throws 500. The api_error is not caught by inherits("api_error", err)
    * R: why is.numeric("9") = FALSE in checkNumber(...)?
    * jsonlite: unboxing does not work for retrieving saved state in savedState(...)


Frontend
========
    * spinner and blocked input/fetch histogram button until result from backend is received
    * convert UTC timestamp to local time


Done
